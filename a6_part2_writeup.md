## Question 1: Feature Importance

Based on your house price model, rank the four features from most important to least important. Explain how you determined this ranking.

**YOUR ANSWER:**
1. Most Important:  Bedrooms
2. Bathrooms
3. Age
4. Least Important: Squarefeet

**Explanation:**
I ranked these four feature from most important to least important according to the statistics that the copmuter gave me. Bedrooms had the most points near $400,000 which shows how much people are willing to pay for the number of bathrooms which shows a great importance. Squarefeet only had like 3 points that were $400,000 which was the least amount of points near $400,000 compared to the other graphs.

## Question 2: Interpreting Coefficients

Choose TWO features from your model and explain what their coefficients mean in plain English. For example: "Each additional bedroom increases the price by $___"

**Feature 1:**
For squarefeet, it showed that every 1000 squarefeet the prices increase by about $12,500. So it showed that the amount of squarefeet didn't really change the prices that awful lot. It is more of a steady increase which shows that it goes up little by little. Compared to bathrooms, square feet is relaively cheap and does not cost much. 

**Feature 2:**
For bathrooms, it shows that every bathroom increased the price by about $80,000. Which is far more then squarefeet which shows more significance. It tells us that bathrooms cost a lot more money than square feet probably due to all the plumbing and pipes.

## Question 3: Model Performance

What was your model's R² score? What does this tell you about how well your model predicts house prices? Is there room for improvement?

**YOUR ANSWER:**
My Root Mean Squared Error was $4477.89. It tells us that the model is pretty accurated when predicting house prices because  considering that we are working in the $200,000-$400,000 which are really big numbers. There is definitely room for improvement because ai is getting really advanced where they could predict that exact value which is pretty exciting.

## Question 4: Adding Features

If you could add TWO more features to improve your house price predictions, what would they be and why?

**Feature 1:**
Type of floor

**Why it would help:**
I think it would act like another bathroom graph which could provide more important and relevant information which could possibly make the house price predictions a little bit more accurate. Also, it's a very common and important feature of the house price. I think it would give more prices so it could have more accurate and specific answers.

**Feature 2:**
Color of the house (interior and exterior)

**Why it would help:**
I think it would be like the same thing as type of floor. It would provide important and relevant information which could help narrow down the house price predictions. Also, there are two parts of the feature which could provide more prices.

## Question 5: Model Trust

Would you trust this model to predict the price of a house with 6 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms, 3000 sq ft, and 5 years old? Why or why not? (Hint: Think about the range of your training data)

**YOUR ANSWER:**
I would trust this model to predict the price of a house with 6 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms, 3000 sq ft, and 5 years old because the model follows a trend of steadily increasing little by little when the variable is increases. For example, square feet follows a steady growth depending on how many square feet. I would imagine that the model would just extend to $450,000 while following the trend/growth from the previous information. For bathroom, I would just imagine a set of prices that cost about $50,000 more than 3 bathrooms because it follows an steady increase.
